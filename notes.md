# Notes for Week Four

I completed the first table using RStudio

There was one spelling mistake with "Edinburgh" written as "Edinbugh". To fix this, I downloaded the cvs file, uploaded it to Open Refine, clustered Edinbugh with Edinburgh, put this file into my Github repository, and curled this URL into RStudio to create a new plot. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rachelnadia/week-four/master/newspaper1.csv

I then plotted the years.

Next I tried a bit of my own experimentation. I opened the cvs file in Open Refine again. I spet a significant amount of time looking at the keywords. I sifted through all the options and clustered them how I see fit (exerting agency as per Week 3 readings). I then plotted the number of articles by keyword to find that a significant amount of the letters were talking about Native American Peoples.

### Voyant

Based on the word images in Voyant, it suggests that the British may have been trying to consolidate their colonies into making them like the British.

## Reading Notes

- digital reading involves more than jsut words on a page

- includes sounds, objects, space

- how do we identify new things to study rather than imposing new methods on older studies?

- combining the text and non-text

- gives context to the history

- close and distant reading = microscope and macroscope

- making the past available for 'scientific purposes'

- Remember: we don't already know the results of the work
