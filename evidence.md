# Evidence for Week Four

## Topic Models

I need to do a little more practice with the Topic Model tool. I understand the outcome in the sense that you can look at the frequency of the topics appearance, but I need to practice a bit more in being able to determine what the topics might mean in order for this to be beneficial. Nevertheless, I managed to follow through with the tutorial and I created a pie chart for some of my results.

From this pie chart and a few others that I created, I noticed that topic 7 came up frequently. It is the steps after opening the html in this topic of zooming in and out, bak and forth between the microscope and the macroscope that I need to practice before I can get anything meaningful out of the data.
