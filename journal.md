# Reflection for Week Four

Oh, so this is how this class is going to be. Every week I feel like I am getting a little bit closer to understanding, and then the new week comes and it throws me off. This week I went through each exercise twice and went back to catch up on the material from previous week to make sure I understand the purpose of the work I am doing. It's still a work in progress, but I was somewhat successful!
